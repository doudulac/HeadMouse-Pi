The HeadMouse Pi is a low cost, universal, head-tracking mouse built from a Raspberry Pi and
Camera Module or ordinary webcam. Its goal is to be a viable computer access technology for
those who lack the ability to use their hands. It offers a low-cost and no-insurance-required 
alternative to more expensive and sophisticated devices.  It requires no special apparatus to be worn 
(e.g. glasses or reflective dots) by the user; instead, it tracks your head in space translating 
the movement and facial gestures into a USB mouse protocol.
