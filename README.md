# HeadMouse Pi

The HeadMouse Pi is a low cost, universal, head-tracking mouse built from a Raspberry Pi and Camera
Module or ordinary webcam. Its goal is to be a viable computer access technology for me and others
who lack the ability to use their hands. It offers a low-cost and no-insurance-required
alternative to larger and more sophisticated devices.  It requires no special apparatus to be worn
(e.g. glasses or reflective dots) by the user; instead, it tracks your head in space and translates
the movement into a USB mouse protocol.

The prototype hardware consists of: 

*   Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB ram ($35)
*   2GB or larger microSD card ($6)
*   Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 (Noir version $25)
*   Argon NEO Pi 4 Raspberry Pi Case ($15)
