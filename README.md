# HeadMouse Pi

**website:** https://doudulac.github.io/HeadMouse-Pi/

The HeadMouse Pi is a low cost, universal, head-tracking mouse built from a Raspberry Pi and
Camera Module or ordinary webcam. Its goal is to be a viable computer access technology for me
and others who lack the ability to use their hands. It offers a low-cost and no-insurance-required 
alternative to larger and more sophisticated devices.  It requires no special apparatus to be worn 
(e.g. glasses or reflective dots) by the user; instead, it tracks your head in space and translates 
the movement into a USB mouse protocol.
